<p>
This basic stemmer for Irish was developed and contributed by Jim
O&#8217;Regan.
</p>

<p>
One thing that should be taken into account with Irish is the initial
mutation (n-eclipsis and h-prothesis) which causes problems if words
are simply folded to lowercase before stemming in the way that is
usually assumed by Snowball stemmers.  A Snowball version of an algorithm to
fold to lowercase while taking this into account would look something like:

<p>
The following characters are vowels for the purposes of this algorithm:

<dl><dd>
    a e i o u &#xE1; &#xE9; &#xED; &#xF3; &#xFA;
</dl>

<p>
The algorithm first addresses the initial mutation, then regions are determined
based on the word after this first step:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>RV</i> is the region after the first vowel, or the end of the word
if it contains no vowels.</li>
<li><I>R</I>1 is the region after the first non-vowel following a vowel, or the
end of the word if there is no such non-vowel.</li>
<li><I>R</I>2 is the region after the first non-vowel following a vowel in
<I>R</I>1, or the end of the word if there is no such non-vowel.</li>
</ul>
