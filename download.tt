<h2>Tarballs</h2>

<p>Several tarballs of the Snowball sources are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="dist/libstemmer_c.tgz">The C version of the libstemmer library.</a><br/>
This contains all you need to include the snowball stemming algorithms into a
C project of your own.  If you download this, you don't need to use the snowball
compiler, or worry about the internals of the stemmers in any way.
</li>
<li>
<a href="dist/libstemmer_csharp.tgz">The C# version of the libstemmer library.</a><br/>
This contains all you need to include the snowball stemming algorithms into a
C# project of your own.  If you download this, you don't need to use the snowball
compiler, or worry about the internals of the stemmers in any way.
</li>
<li>
<a href="dist/libstemmer_java.tgz">The Java version of the libstemmer library.</a><br/>
This contains all you need to include the snowball stemming algorithms into a
Java project of your own.  If you download this, you don't need to use the snowball
compiler, or worry about the internals of the stemmers in any way.
</li>
<li>
<a href="dist/snowball_code.tgz">Snowball, algorithms, and libstemmer library.</a><br/>
This contains all the source code for snowball (but not the generated source files).
This is useful mainly if you are wanting to work on the algorithms (tweaking them,
or producing new algorithms).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not make binary (ie, compiled) distributions of snowball available -
there are simply too many different platforms, architectures and languages to
support.  If you are willing to make such binaries available for others, and
can provide at least some measure of support for ensuring that they work, feel
free to contact us and we will add a link to your work from this site.
</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>
We provide and support python wrappers for Snowball.  The latest code can
be downloaded from the <a
href="https://github.com/snowballstem/pystemmer">PyStemmer repo</a>.
</p>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>
Developers may wish to access the latest source using the command:
