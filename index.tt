<strong>Snowball</strong> is a small string processing language designed for creating stemming
algorithms for use in Information Retrieval. This site describes Snowball, and presents
several useful stemmers which have been implemented using it.
</p>

<p>
The Snowball compiler translates a Snowball script into another language -
currently ISO C, C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Object Pascal, Python and Rust
are supported.

- You can look at the stemming algorithm definitions themselves, and use
them as templates for coding your own versions of stemmers in the computer
language of your choice.

<BR><BR>
- You can use the various ANSI C
and Java stemmers in programs of your own,
without bothering yourself
with the Snowball system that generated them. To do that,
download either the

<A HREF="../dist/libstemmer_c.tgz">C</A>
or the
<A HREF="../dist/libstemmer_java.tgz">Java</A>

version of the libstemmer library, and follow the instructions
contained in the &nbsp;<code>README</code>&nbsp; files within these tarballs.
The tarballs also contain simple example
programs which allow you to run the stemmers from the command line.
<BR><BR>

- You can get involved in Snowball itself. This is particularly worthwhile
if you want to adjust the stemmers or develop new stemmers. A typical reason
for adjusting the stemmers is that you are working with a different encoding
of accented letters from the ISO Latin I encoding assumed in most of the scripts
here. Then you need to make your own version of the Snowball compiler and
work with the Snowball scripts.

Add new backends to the Snowball compiler...

 The language has a full

    <A HREF="../compiler/snowman.html"> manual</A>,

and the various stemming scripts act as example programs.

- You can get deeply interested in stemming. If you do, read the

    <A HREF="../texts/introduction.html"> introductory paper</A>

about Snowball. It is a bit heavyweight, but provides essential background.
And look at the

    <A HREF="../texts/howtohelp.html"> notes</A>

on how you can help.

Since it effectively provides a &#8216;<I>suffix STRIPPER GRAMmar</I>&#8217;, I had toyed with the
idea of calling it &#8216;<I>strippergram</I>&#8217;, but good sense has prevailed, and so it is
&#8216;<I>Snowball</I>&#8217; named as a tribute to SNOBOL, the excellent string handling language
of Messrs Farber, Griswold, Poage and Polonsky from the 1960s.
