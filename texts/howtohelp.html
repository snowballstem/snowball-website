<p>
For the work on this site there are two possible lines of development, one is
Snowball itself &#x2014; the language and compiler &#x2014; and the other is the
stemmers which are written in Snowball. At the moment it is the latter that
is the real area of interest.
</p>

<p>
It is useful to have suggestions about improvements to the existing
stemmers, especially for the ones which are not English. However, the
process of piecemeal improvement can be taken too far, and it is important
in making these suggestions to recognise the inevitable limitations of
accuracy of algorithmic stemmers. But more importantly: &#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Stemming algorithms have a well-understood place in IR (Information
Retrieval), and as language-specific tools in an IR system, they have an
extremely useful part to play. It is therefore something of a scandal that
there are so very few stemming algorithms which are readily available, so
if you want to make a contribution to Snowball, the best thing you can do
is to create a good quality stemmer for a new language. This must
include an algorithmic description of the stemmer, an implementation in
Snowball, and a representative language vocabulary of about 30,000 words
that can be used as part of a standard test.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you might come up with the algorithm and be able to provide
representative texts from which to derive the vocabulary, but hesitate
about the Snowball implementation. If so, get in touch, and we might be
able to complete the work collaboratively.
</p>

<p>
We are also interested in:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Significant applications developed with the Snowball stemmers

<li> Stemmers held on other sites that derive from Snowball work

<li> Other useful stemming resources
</ul>

<p>
It may seem like stating the obvious, but if you do hit a technical
problem, please, please send in a full notice of the system being used,
the activity you were engaged on, and the errors that you encounter.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you want to contribute to this site, you must be prepared to
release under the BSD license (i.e. to make your work free).
